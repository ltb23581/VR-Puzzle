# UGA Virtual Reality 2025 ‚Äì Portfolio ‚Äì Demo 4: Interactive Puzzle Game üß©üéÆ

## Description
This project was created for the **University of Georgia Virtual Reality course** as part of my VR class portfolio.  
It is an **interactive VR puzzle experience** focused on precise object manipulation. Players enter a virtual space where puzzle pieces drop to the ground and must pick up, move, and correctly place each piece using tracked controllers.

## Core Features üéÆ
1. Built and tested on both **Android** and **Windows**, designed to run on a **VR headset** with two **tracked hand controllers**.  

2. **Natural interaction:** Players can **grab, release, and throw** puzzle pieces intuitively.  

3. **Hover highlighting:** Pieces visually respond when the controller is close enough to interact.  

4. **Guided assembly:** An in-world **hint board** helps players place pieces correctly.  

5. **Real-time state tracking:** The game detects when all puzzle pieces are placed in the correct spots.  

6. **Celebration feedback:** A **completion sound** plays when the puzzle is successfully solved, confirming progression.
